Garry, Judit and Vishi are strolling at the pawn’s park. They see a chess table with three seats and their eyes light up! As if they have seen a treasure.

You guessed it right, they were indeed carrying chess pieces in their bags. Without wasting any time, they jump right onto the table to settle who is the best, once for all!

All were enthused but couldn’t just agree to be observer while the two players battled it out in a conventional setup. Just like always, Judit had a solution to it. All agreed on Judit’s plan for the decisive battle! Here’s what it was:

1.	No player was to get an alliance
2.	All three will take turns to play one move at a time
3.	One who checkmates wins, And the other two lose.
4.	Winner gets anointed as the “Omni Chess King!”

Now imagine that it was a virtual park, the three friends were ambling at. You guessed it right again, they were indeed using their online avatars to play an online-chess game with a title on line! The only challenge is that this platform doesn’t exist, can you pull a quick hack and assemble a quick prototype for the three friends? It may look something like the image below:
